## Shared Design References

The `docs/shared/` HTML files are retained as design references. They are not the source of truth for current behavior:

- `docs/shared/teamwork-design.html` - historical Teamwork design proposal, partly implemented and partly superseded.
- `docs/shared/teamwork-ui-mockup.html` - static UI mockup that reuses production CSS for visual reference.

When docs and code disagree, treat code and tests as authoritative, then update the docs.
